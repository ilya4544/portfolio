# portfolio

Project for developing and maintenance personal sites & portfolio.
It works on Node.js but you could generate static assets and upload it to any basic hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages).

Use all top-notch technologies: write on ES6, compile styles from SASS and templates from Jade, 
add browsers prefixes, use json for your resume data.

## Quick start
  * Clone repo
  * Move to the projects folder
  * Install all packages: `npm install`
  * Run bundler: `webpack`
  * You can find generated files in the `dist` folder
  
## Developer version
  * Additionally install webpack dev server: `npm install webpack-dev-server`
  * Now you can run `webpack-dev-server` and get working site at `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`. If you change code
  it refresh automatically.
